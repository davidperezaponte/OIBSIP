## Projects

### Project 1: [IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION]

- **Description:**
Iris flower has three species; setosa, versicolor, and virginica, which differs according to their
measurements. Now assume that you have the measurements of the iris flowers according to
their species, and here your task is to train a machine learning model that can learn from the
measurements of the iris species and classify them. Although the Scikit-learn library provides a dataset for iris flower classification, you can also
download the same dataset from here for the task of iris flower classification with Machine
Learning.

- **Objective:** Create a machine learning model to classify the species of the dataset
- **Skills:** Machine learning, classification, pandas, python, supervised algorithms, logistic regretion, Random Forest

### Project 2: [UNEMPLOYMENT ANALYSIS WITH PYTHON]

- **Description:** 
Unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate which is the number of people
who are unemployed as a percentage of the total labour force. We have seen a sharp
increase in the unemployment rate during Covid-19, so analyzing the unemployment rate
can be a good data science project.

- **Objective:** Analysis of statistics of unemployment in India
- **Skills:** Data visualization, analysis, data-driven, matplotlib, seaborn, pandas
- **Data:** [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gokulrajkmv/unemployment-in-india](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gokulrajkmv/unemployment-in-india)

### Project 3: [SALES PREDICTION USING PYTHON]

- **Description:** 
Sales prediction means predicting how much of a product people will buy based on factors
such as the amount you spend to advertise your product, the segment of people you
advertise for, or the platform you are advertising on about your product. Typically, a product and service-based business always need their Data Scientist to predict
their future sales with every step they take to manipulate the cost of advertising their
product. So letâ€™s start the task of sales prediction with machine learning using Python.

- **Objective:** Create a machine learning model to predict sales based on the investment in publicity 
- **Skills:** Machine learning, classification, pandas, python, supervised algorithms,Linear regression
